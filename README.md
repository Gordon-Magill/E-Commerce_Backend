## Installation

Run "npm i" in the project directory after cloning. Edit the .env.EXAMPLE file to strip off the dummy suffix and add your own db credentials. Load the mysql db schema (in ./db) and seed the db using "npm run seed".

## Usage

Run "node server" in the project directory. Interact with the backend using tools such as Insomnia to test routes (such as localhost:3001/api/products/) and utilize the db functionality.
